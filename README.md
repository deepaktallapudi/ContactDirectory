# ContactDirectory

This project is designed and implemented to inform the user about a search query for the phone directory. This application uses to refer the contact details easily.



As we all busy with our daily works, isn’t easy to remember our family, friends and other details or contact numbers. so, our task is to implement a smartphone directory that collects contact data from the user  until the user prompts the program to contact data refers to the contact’s name, phone number, date-ofbirth, a category that contact belongs to (Friends, Family, Work, Other), e-mail address. The user may enter as much data as he can in the mentioned data labels. If some labels remain void of data, store it as None. A name & the number is mandatory to create contact. Implement the following operations on the
directory: Insert, Delete, Search, Display. We have developed this project by using 8 functions, namely:
Initial _phonebook() : The first function to run, it initializes the phonebook.
Menu (): It displays the choices available to the user and returns the choice entered.
Add _contact (): It adds a new contact to the Contacts directory.
Remove _existing (): It removes an existing contact from the Contacts directory.
Delete _all (): It deletes all the contacts from the Contacts directory.
display_ all (): It displays all the contacts from the Contacts directory.
Search _existing (): It will search and display an existing contact in the Contacts directory.
